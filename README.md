### Getting Started

1\. First of all you need to clone Coronatime App repository from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/nikoloz-danelia-coronatime
```

2\. Next step requires you to run _composer install_ in order to install all the dependencies.

```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

and also:

```sh
npm run dev
```

in order to build your JS/SaaS resources.

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#

**MYSQL:**

> DB_CONNECTION=mysql

> DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

> DB_PORT=3306

> DB_DATABASE=**\***

> DB_USERNAME=**\***

> DB_PASSWORD=**\***

#

**EMAIL**

> MAIL_DRIVER=smtp

> MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

> MAIL_PORT=465

> MAIL_USERNAME=**\***

> MAIL_PASSWORD=**\***

> MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl

> MAIL_FROM_NAME=**\***

#

after setting up **.env** file, execute:

```sh
php artisan config:cache
```

in order to cache environment variables.

5\. Now execute in the root of you project following:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

##### Now, you should be good to go!

#

### Migration

if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

#

### Development

You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Build js files:

```sh
npm run dev
```

it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.

To fetch stats execute:

```sh
php artisan coronatime:fetch-covid-stats
```
